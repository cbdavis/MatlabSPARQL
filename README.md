MatlabSPARQL
============

The [sparql.m]() file contains code for running queries against SPARQL endpoints and downloading the data as a struct into Matlab

#Known Issues
* Currently only works with TSV output
 * CSV parsing is easy to implement, XML parsing would requite more effort to deal with data types returned
